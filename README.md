####Junior Full Stack Web Developer

I am a London-based Junior Full Stack Web Developer, and a recent graduate of **Makers Academy**, Europe's leading developer bootcamp.  

I am driven by curiosity, and my ambitions mostly centre on my own development.  My leadership skills bring a natural momentum to any project, and my enthusiasm is infectious.

A desire to use my analytical skills to create tangible products has inspired my move into Web Development.  Making something that solves a problem, that can make a person's life a little easier, better or more fun will give me a deep sense of fulfilment, as it appeals to my creative nature.  **Coding makes me happy**.

## Skills

#### Pace of learning
I can pick up new technologies and languages at the drop of a hat.  In a recent project (as a small team of 4) we built a React based task manager app which linked to an Express / Node.js back-end, Sequelize database and was tested using Jest. We did this in a week despite none of us having had any prior experience with any of those technologies. The project was my idea, and I led the charge in terms of designing the project structure and helping team members to learn effectively.

#### Designing tools and applications
During my studies I have developed a passion for clean code, and I love domain modelling and refactoring.  At Innocent I redesigned and built a number of key business tools using Excel; managing iterations using agile methodologies.  This aspect of my role gave me **so much joy and satisfaction**, it inspired me to learn how to code.

#### Driving Development
At Innocent I had a role reporting to me, and I relished the challenge of supporting someone else's development.  When we were asked to share feedback on each other, my cohort praised my communication skills and my **ability to help others learn**.  

#### Cross-Functional Leadership
A key strength of mine is **feeling confident in situations where I don't have any of the answers**, but can ask the right questions.  At Innocent I managed a range optimisation and compliance project despite having no experience in that area. My ability to quickly establish a clear overview created the clarity and structure that the project needed.

#### Blogging
The blog that I started to document my coding journey has had over 2k views, and I've had articles published in Code Like A Girl and Makers Academy.  I've also been booked to speak on the Ruby Rogues podcast.  Check out my blog [here](https://medium.com/@malinnaleach).
